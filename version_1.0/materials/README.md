This folder contains **utility files and scripts** that support the main functionalities of the repository. Below is an overview of the contents and their purposes:

## üìä Manual Analysis Results
The ``manual_analysis.xlsx`` is an Excel file containing the manual analysis of the code samples used in the paper (i.e., the snippets from the ``DeVAIC\input`` folder). 
The Excel file has four sheets, each containing the 125 code samples generated by each of the four models (i.e., GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI ChatGPT). 
Each row in a sheet contains the manual analysis of the corresponding line in the respective text file in the input folder.


## üõ†Ô∏è Code Transformation

The ``create_snippet.py`` is a Python script that reads **.py** source code files from a specified folder (e.g., ``code_test``) and generates a **.txt** file in another folder (e.g., ``file_snippet``). The output file contains the original **.py files converted into a single-line format**, with line breaks represented explicitly as \n. 

This **.txt** output file can be moved to the ``DeVAIC\input`` folder and, then, launch the tool.

### Usage Example:
1. Place the source .py files into the ``code_test`` folder.
2. Define a name for the output .txt file by modifying the ``out_filename`` variable within the ``create_snippet.py`` script.
3. Move to ``utils`` folder and run the script:
```python
python create_snippet.py
```
